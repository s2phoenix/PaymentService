# ðŸ’¸ Payment Service (POC for Bank System)

This project is a **minimal payment service** created to support the `POCBankService`.  
It's designed to be **simple and cute** ðŸ˜„ â€” just enough to demonstrate how an external service can be integrated via API.

## ðŸ§  Main Logic

1. **Query transaction holding** â€“ fetch transactions that are pending or in-process.
2. **Apply to transaction info** â€“ finalize or update transaction records.

This project exposes a **very simple API** for testing and demonstration purposes.

- Act as a mock external service for **POCBankService**
- Showcase how to **call external APIs** from the main monolith using real logic
- Keep the codebase lightweight and focused
